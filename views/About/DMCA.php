<li>Identify the material that you claim is infringing and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and sufficiently describe its location on our website.</li>
<li>Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address.</li>
<li>Include a statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
<li>Include a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and that, under penalty of perjury, you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>

<p>If you fail to comply with all of the requirements, your DMCA notification might be invalid. Under the DMCA, we may respond to valid notifications by disabling access to or removing allegedly infringing material, terminating the accounts of repeated infringers, and making good-faith efforts to contact alleged infringers so that they might make appropriate counter-notifications.</p>
<p>Before filing a notification, please carefully consider whether the use of copyrighted material at issue is protected by the "fair use" doctrine, as you could be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees, for a take-down notice if there is no infringing use.</p>
<p>
<strong>
Counter-Notification
</strong>
</p>
<p>If your material was removed (or made inaccessible), and you believe that it does not infringe, or that you have authorization for its use from the copyright owner, its agent, or the law, you may send a written counter-notification (by postal mail or fax) to our copyright agent, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the material and its prior location on our website.</li>
<li>Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address.</li>
<li>Include a statement that you believe, under penalty of perjury, that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>
<li>Include a statement that you consent to jurisdiction of the federal district court for the district where you reside (or of the Southern District of New York if you reside outside the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under DMCA subsection (c)(1)(C), or an agent of such person.</li>
<li>Sign the document.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the DMCA, we may reinstate the material in response to a proper counter-notification. Please note that you could be liable for damages (including costs and attorney's fees) if you knowingly misrepresent that material is not infringing the copyrights of others.</p>
